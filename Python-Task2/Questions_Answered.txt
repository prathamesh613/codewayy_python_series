Day 2 Questions :

Q1.  Why is list used?

Ans. List is a built-in Data Structure in Python.
     It is a collection of different types of elements such as :
     integer, float, string, etc enclosed in a square bracket [ ].

Q2.  How do lists and sets differ?

Ans. The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python.
     Lists can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
     Important thing about a list is that the items in a list need not be of the same type.

     A set in Python is a unordered collection of data.
     Lists supports indexing but sets does not support indexing.
     Lists does not remove duplicate values but sets removes duplicate values.
     Lists are faster than sets.

Q3.  Application of Dictionaries with a real world example.

Ans. In real world, dictionary can be used as item price storage in a restaurant.
     For Ex: 'Biryani' and 'Chicken' are ordered. order = ['Biryani', 'Chicken']
     Costs are 250 and 200 respectively.
     Total bill can be given as:
     for item in order:
      if item in food_dictionary:
        total += food_dictionary[item]


List          collection        ordered       changeable      Allows duplicate members.
Tuple         collection        ordered       unchangeable    Allows duplicate members.
Set           collection        unordered                     No duplicate members.           unindexed
Dictionary    collection        unordered     changeable      No duplicate members            indexed
